 Map Engine
 <p>
 When directing and guiding autonomous vehicles, there's need for a new kind of map,
 one that incorporates much more data, is blazing fast and runs anywhere without fail.
 Using a concise object model is a way to establish a solid framework for such a map. 
 This model focuses on the data itself, rather than structures crafted elsewhere for 
 a different purpose. The objective of this map architecture is to create a competitive 
 market advantage for autonomous vehicles that use it. <p>
 
 While choosing names for data, three objectives should guide us:<p>
 1. Choose clear/simple names that help avoid misunderstandings that cause bugs.<p>
 2. Choose names that make the code easier to read, by humans, our future selves. <p>
 3. Keep the names general enough so expected changes won't make them obsolete. <p>
 
 Where conflicts in naming data components arise, preference is given to terms 
 used by actual transportation engineers, rather than terms from computer science 
 or mathematics. Some names are modified to avoid conflicts with programming 
 language key words. The best names are also valued for their brevity. <p>
 
 Starting with the simplest objects first:<p>

 "Location" is a point on the planet. It has three basic parts: latitude, longitude 
 and elevation. Although GPS systems use the name altitude, we use elevation because 
 that is the term used in geography and transportation science. <p>
 
 "Node" is a location that links to other nodes and locations. It is a common term widely
 accepted in transportation and mathematics. The main risk with using node is confusion. 
 Node is also used in many other ways in computer science, generative grammar, astronomy 
 and physics. But here, brevity and acceptance seem to outweigh the risk of future confusion.<p>
 
 "distance" is a better name than length. Here length might lead to later confusion because
 length might also refer to time or smaller measurements near the vehicle itself. There is 
 less ambiguity in the word distance. Vehicles travel a distance, not a length.<p>
 
 "direction" is used to define the course along which something moves. The word bearing 
 is more often associated with the way a vehicle moves. This may lead to a dangerous future
 confusion. When describing a road it is more specific to refer to the course, not 
 vehicle movement.<p>
 
 "Turn" is used here to name the action taken by a vehicle. It is both brief and clear.<p>
 
 "EndLane" describes one possible lane available for a vehicle to exit a link. End is 
 part of this name to protect us from our future selves. It must remain clear that these
 lanes are at the end of the link construct.<p>
 
 "Link" is a straight line with direction defining a short piece of a transportation network.
 It is a vector, with distance and direction, and is the fundamental construct of this 
 overall object model. Maps are basically collections of nodes. Nodes both define and are 
 defined by links. Other terms like segment are less clear and less specific. Most importantly,
 link is a term used by transportation engineers and makers of transportation maps.<p>
 
 "Route" contains a contiguous series of links and defines a plan for getting from a 
 point of "origin" to a "destination". Although Route is often pronounced differently (some 
 say "r-out", others "root"), the word route is often associated with travel along a road 
 and is the word used to describe routing problems like the VRP (vehicle routing problem). 
 These three conventions - Route, origin and destination, appear to be the terms used by 
 transportation engineers. Using them focuses the model on its external use rather than 
 its underlying mathematics. No one boards an airliner to reach their drop-off or their 
 point B. They arrive at an actual location, their destination. Likewise, although Uber 
 may send a driver to a pickup location, what they really do is send the driver to the 
 point of route origin. Furthermore, the object model is intended not just for taxi 
 services, but also for applied autonomy of owner-directed vehicles. An owner may 
 not need to be picked up, as their vehicle is already with them. But most importantly, 
 route, origin and destination are the terms in active use by transportation engineers.<p>
 
 "AreaMap" is simply a collection of nodes that define a transportation network. The node
 objects themselves all know how to link with one another. AreaMap also includes locations
 which are not necessarily nodes. The other locations can be points of interest segmented 
 by type or class. An AreaMap defines a chosen area, effectively establishing boundaries of 
 operation.<p>
 
 In summary, these are the five (5) basic object classes use by the Map Engine: <p>
 
 Location is any point on earth: latitude, longitude and elevation.<p>
 
 Node is a Location on a road with a set of links that begin or end there.<p>
 
 Link connects only two Nodes along a road in only one direction.<p>
 
 Route describes how to get from origin to destination.<p>
 
 AreaMap contains all roads and notable locations in an area.</dd>
